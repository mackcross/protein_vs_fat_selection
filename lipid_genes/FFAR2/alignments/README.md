were downloaded from ensembl.org. 


## NCBI Download
On 10/27/23, the human FFAR2 gene (ENSG00000126262.5) from Ensembl was queried in NCBI's 
BlastN in the NR database for orthologous sequences not available from Ensembl. 
The default max target sequence parameter was adjusted to 5000. These 
sequences were downloaded in aligned fasta format. Any sequence of questionable 
quality was removed.
